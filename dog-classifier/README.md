# Project Brief: Image Classification for a City Dog Show

## Project Goal

* Improving your programming skills using Python.

In this project, you will use a created image classifier to identify dog breeds. We ask you to focus on Python and not on the actual classifier.


## Principal Objectives

* Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.
* Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.
* Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve objectives 1 and 2.
* Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.
