Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
No. AlexNet and ResNet guess it right while VGG got it wrong

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes, all 3 model detect Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as a same breed

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
Yes, they got it right

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
AlexNet and ResNet classified dog images correctly. But when classifying object, ResNet give the most similiar answer (my object is a laptop. ResNet answer "Notebook" while AlexNet answer "Monitor"). I'll use ResNet model architecture because it seems the data is more robust and varied than AlexNet.
